# Scooterson Backend Engineer Intern Technical Task

## Description
This project is a sophisticated Node.js application that leverages the power of Express.js for server-side operations and MongoDB as the NoSQL database. It includes a comprehensive set of RESTful API endpoints for managing blog posts in a CRUD (Create, Read, Update, Delete) fashion. The platform is designed with advanced features such as caching, search functionality, view tracking, and content-based recommendations.


## System Architecture
The application follows a typical MVC (Model-View-Controller) architecture. The Express.js framework is used to set up the server and handle HTTP requests and responses. The MongoDB database is used for data persistence, and Mongoose is used as an Object Data Modeling (ODM) library for MongoDB and Node.js. A caching mechanism is implemented using Redis to optimize the retrieval of frequently accessed data.

## Data Model
The data model for the blog posts includes fields for the title, content, author, view count, and timestamps for creation and last update. Relationships between users and blog posts are implemented where necessary. Mongoose's built-in validation features are used to ensure that the data sent to our API endpoints is in the correct format.

## Setup and Installation

1. Clone the repository to your local machine using Git, a distributed version control system.
2. Navigate to the project directory using the command line interface.
3. Install the necessary npm packages by running `npm install`. This command reads the `package.json` file to determine the project's dependencies and installs them.
4. Create a `.env` file in the root directory of the project, and add the following environment variables:
    ```
    NODE_ENV = development
    PORT = 5001
    MONGO_URI = mongodb+srv://username:password@cluster0.ugavlzc.mongodb.net/
    JWT_SECRET = abc123
    ```
    Replace `username`, `password`, and `abc123` with your MongoDB username, password, and your chosen JWT secret, respectively. These environment variables are crucial for the configuration of your application.

## Running the Application

To start the application, run `npm start` in the terminal. This command starts the Node.js application. The application will be accessible at `http://localhost:5001`.

## API Endpoints

The application includes the following RESTful API endpoints for managing blog posts:

- `GET /api/posts`: Fetch all posts. This endpoint retrieves all the blog posts stored in the MongoDB database.
- `GET /api/posts/:id`: Fetch a single post by its `_id`. This endpoint retrieves a specific blog post using its unique identifier.
- `POST /api/posts`: Create a new post. This endpoint allows the creation of a new blog post.
- `PUT /api/posts/:id`: Update a post by its `_id`. This endpoint updates the details of a specific blog post.
- `DELETE /api/posts/:id`: Delete a post by its `_id`. This endpoint deletes a specific blog post from the database.

## Challenges and Solutions

During the development of this project, I faced several challenges:

### Error Handling
One of the significant challenges I faced was handling errors effectively in asynchronous route handlers. In a dynamic project like mine, it’s crucial to have robust error handling mechanisms to ensure smooth operation and a great user experience.

**Solution**: To tackle this, I utilized the `express-async-handler` package. This middleware is specifically designed to handle errors in asynchronous route handlers. It catches any rejected promises that are thrown in route handlers and passes them along to Express’s built-in error handling middleware. This allows me to centralize my error handling logic, making my code cleaner and easier to maintain.

### Data Validation
Another challenge was ensuring the integrity of the data sent to my API endpoints. With multiple data transactions happening simultaneously, there was a risk of receiving data in incorrect formats, which could potentially disrupt my application’s functionality.

**Solution**: To address this, I leveraged Mongoose’s built-in validation features. Mongoose is a powerful tool that provides a straight-forward, schema-based solution to model my application data. Its built-in validation features allowed me to set up rules that the incoming data must adhere to before it’s accepted into my system. This helped me maintain the integrity of my data and prevented potential issues that could arise from malformed data.


## Middleware and Performance
Middleware is implemented to compress API responses for improved performance. Database queries are optimized for efficiency, and asynchronous processing is used where applicable.

## Security
Advanced security measures are implemented, including rate limiting, request validation, and protection against common web vulnerabilities.

# Horizontal Scaling for this platform (Future Reference)

## Step 1: Load Balancing
The first step in horizontal scaling is setting up a load balancer. The load balancer distributes incoming network traffic across multiple servers to ensure no single server bears too much demand. This allows for high availability and reliability by redirecting requests only to servers that are online.

We can use solutions like Nginx or HAProxy for load balancing. These tools offer powerful and flexible features, such as SSL termination, HTTP/2 support, and advanced monitoring and logging.

## Step 2: Stateless Application
Ensure that our application is stateless, i.e., any application server can handle any request. we should not store session-related data in memory. Instead, store session data in a centralized data store which all instances can access.

## Step 3: Database Sharding
As our application grows, our database could become a bottleneck. To overcome this, we can use a technique called sharding, where we break our large database into smaller, more manageable parts called shards. Sharding can be complex because it involves creating and managing multiple database schemas. MongoDB supports sharding out of the box.

## Step 4: Replication
Replication involves maintaining multiple copies of data on different database servers to ensure high availability and redundancy. MongoDB supports replication through Replica Sets.

## Step 5: Caching
Implement a robust caching mechanism to reduce the load on our databases. we can use in-memory databases like Redis or Memcached for caching.

## Step 6: Asynchronous Processing
Consider using asynchronous processing for tasks that are IO-intensive or take a lot of time, such as sending emails, image processing, etc. This way, we don't block the application from taking more requests while these tasks are being processed.

## Step 7: Monitoring and Scaling Policies
Finally, implement a robust monitoring solution to keep track of our servers' health and performance. Use this data to create policies that determine when to add more servers to our pool (scale out) or remove servers from our pool (scale in).

Remember, scaling is not a one-time task but a continuous process. As our application grows, we need to continuously monitor its performance and make necessary adjustments.

## Conclusion

This project demonstrates the basic functionality of a blog post management system. It includes features such as fetching, creating, updating, and deleting posts. The project is designed to be scalable and includes robust error handling and data validation. It's a testament to the power of modern web development technologies and best practices to be honest
